First project, travelling tips.

This is a first time project developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Here I will be exploring some basics concepts of the above mentioned languages, to create my very first website page.

I will be putting in practice, all the learning I acquired with The Odin Project and some videos on youtube.

Any references and credits will be given at the end of the project.
